# Data Migrations
A simple  prototype showing a couple ways to do migrations using Fluent Migrations and Evolve.

## Getting Started Fluent Migrations
* ```docker-compose up```
* Start the api project using your favorite method (Visual Studio F5, VS Code)
* Celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Getting Started Evolve
* ```docker-compose-up```
* Use NPM scripts
    * migrate-db: run migrations using the evolve CLI
    * migrate-info: migration info using the evolve CLI
    * migrate-db-dotnet: run migrations using the evolve .NET tool
    * migrate-info-dotnet: migration info using the evolve .NET tool
* To use the .NET tool
    * ```dotnet tool install --global Evolve.Tool```
* Or alternatively you can run the scripts using the .NET Core Generic Host project (\evolve\EvolveMigrations.csproj)
* Move scripts from the ```migrations_to_be_moved``` folder to ```migrations``` to try out different migrations
* [Learn more about Evolve](https://evolve-db.netlify.app/)

## What happened?
If everything worked you should now be able to view your sql server instance running in docker at ```localhost:1402``` and there should be multiple databases and tables created. Check out the migrations folder of the Data.FluentMigrations project to check it out. 

All of this is done in-process in our application. But it can also be done in a CI/CD process using a CLI or the dotnet fm package. See the [migration runners](https://fluentmigrator.github.io/articles/migration-runners.html?tabs=vs-pkg-manager-console) for more info.
